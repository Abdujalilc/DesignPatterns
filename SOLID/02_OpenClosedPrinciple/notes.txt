The Open-Closed Principle states that 

	"Software entities such as modules, classes, functions, etc. 
	should be open for extension, 
	but closed for modification".

--------------------------------------

It means:
Open for extension → You can add new functionality.
Closed for modification → You should not change existing code.

✅ Good approach: Use abstraction (e.g., interfaces, base classes) so new features can be added without modifying existing code.
