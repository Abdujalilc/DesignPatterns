# 🏛️ Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository! This is your one-stop resource for learning and implementing software design principles that lead to clean, maintainable, and scalable code. 

## 📂 Project Structure

- **DRY_KISS_YAGNI/** 🧹  
  - "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) – Eliminate redundancy.  
  - "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) – Simplicity over complexity.  
  - "You Ain’t Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) – Build what is needed, not what *might* be needed.

- **GOF/** 🎭  
  - The famous **"Gang of Four"** design patterns:
    - Creational Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder...)
    - Structural Patterns (Adapter, Decorator, Composite...)
    - Behavioral Patterns (Observer, Strategy, Command...)

- **SOLID/** 🏗️  
  - The **Five Pillars** of OOP best practices:
    - **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
    - **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)  
    - **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
    - **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
    - **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  

## 🛠️ Why This Matters?

- **Improve Code Maintainability** – Make future changes easier.
- **Enhance Readability** – Write code that speaks for itself.
- **Increase Scalability** – Adapt your application to future needs.
