OOP elements:

	Classes → Blueprints for objects
	Objects → Instances of classes
	Interfaces → Define contracts for classes
	Abstract Classes → Partially implemented classes
	Constructors → Special methods for object initialization
	Destructors → Cleanup logic before an object is removed
	Methods → Define behaviors of a class
	Properties → Encapsulated fields with getters/setters
	Fields → Store data within a class
	Static Members → Shared across all instances
	Access Modifiers → Control visibility (public, private, etc.)
