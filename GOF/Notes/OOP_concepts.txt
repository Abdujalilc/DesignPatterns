OOP concepts: 
	Abstraction
	Encapsulation
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism
	
--------------------------------------------------

1️. Abstraction → Hides complex details, showing only essential features. (e.g., using List.Add() without knowing internal implementation.)

2️. Encapsulation → Restricts direct access to data, allowing controlled modification via methods. (e.g., private fields with public getters/setters.)

3️. Inheritance → Allows a class to derive properties and behaviors from another class. (e.g., Car inherits from Vehicle.)

4. Polymorphism → Enables a single interface to represent multiple implementations. (e.g., method overriding in derived classes.)
