Proxy Pattern →
🔹 Controls access to an object (lazy loading, logging, security).
🔹 Acts as an intermediary to add extra functionality.

Example:
IService service = new ServiceProxy();
service.Request(); // Proxy logs and delegates to RealService

✔️ Key Idea: Adds control & functionality without modifying the real object.
