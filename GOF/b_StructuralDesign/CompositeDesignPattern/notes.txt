Composite Pattern →
🔹 Treats individual and composite objects uniformly
🔹 Enables part-whole hierarchies for flexibility

Example:
IGraphic circle = new Circle();  
IGraphic group = new Group();  
group.Add(circle);  
group.Draw(); // Draws all components  

✔️ Key Idea: Allows clients to work with single objects and groups in the same way!
