Flyweight Pattern →
🔹 Minimizes memory usage by sharing objects.
🔹 Separates intrinsic (shared) state from extrinsic (context) state.

Example:
IShape shape1 = ShapeFactory.GetCircle();
shape1.Draw("Red");

IShape shape2 = ShapeFactory.GetCircle();
shape2.Draw("Blue"); // Same object, different color

✔️ Key Idea: Reuses shared objects to reduce memory consumption.
