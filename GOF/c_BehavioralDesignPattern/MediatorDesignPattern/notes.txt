Mediator Pattern →
🔹 Centralizes communication between objects to reduce direct dependencies

Example:
var mediator = new ChatMediator();
var user1 = new User(mediator, "Alice");
var user2 = new User(mediator, "Bob");

mediator.Register(user1).Register(user2);
user1.Send("Hello!"); // Bob receives: "Hello!"

✔️ Key Idea: Objects communicate through the mediator instead of talking directly.

Key Concept:
✔ Encapsulation – Centralized communication logic
✔ Decoupling – Components don’t reference each other directly
✔ Scalability – New objects can join without modifying others

Takeaway:
✔ Mediator controls communication flow
✔ Reduces dependencies between objects
✔ Used in chat systems, UI components, and workflow engines
