Builder Pattern →
🔹 Separates construction from representation
🔹 Allows step-by-step creation
🔹 Supports different representations while keeping the process uniform

Example:
Product product = builder.BuildPartOne().BuildPartTwo()/*constructions*/.GetResult()/*representation*/;

✔️ Key Idea: Controlled, flexible object creation!
